var FUS3 = require("fetch-upload-s3");

var fus3 = new FUS3({
  s3_bucket_name,
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
  AWS_REGION,
});

// For fetch url :
fus3.init(function () {
  fus3.do("http://nodejs.org/images/logo.png", "my_key", function (err, data) {
    console.log("file uploaded to S3!");
    console.log(data);
  });
});

// for upload File :
fus3.init(function () {
  fus3.uploadFile(absoluteFilePath, "my_key", function (err, data) {
